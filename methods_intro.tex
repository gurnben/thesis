The following sections will overview our general-purpose architecture for web-based interactive data visualization.  The architecture will be overviewed in 3 parts: server-side, data transmission, and client-side.  Each part will provide an overview of that segmentsâ€™ architecture and then focus specifically on the key elements and abstractions.  Most architectural elements address one or more common problems overviewed in section 4. Each section and subsection will present both an abstract overview of the architectural element(s) as well as an example implementation from the Beestream application. \par
