Updated a 2013 LaTeX style for AppState theses. Use the ./build.sh script to
handle all the building (latex, bibtex, another latex to get references
correct, a kludge fix for table of contents, and finally pdflatex to generate
a PDF.

Look at the thesis.tex file to see how to "define" the specific frontmatter
entries (names, degrees, departments, etc.).
